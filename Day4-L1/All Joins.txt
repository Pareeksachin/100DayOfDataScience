#Inner Join : fatch only matching records from both tables

#Ques: Get the details of employees along with their corresponding department names. don't fatch employees those do not belong to any department
select emp.emp_name, dept.dept_name from employee emp join department dept on emp.dept_id = dept.dept_id;

#Left join : Retrieve all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table, with NULL values in place where there is no match

#Ques : List all employees and their corresponding managers, including employees without managers
select emp.emp_name,mng.manager_name from employee emp left join manager mng on emp.manager_id=mng.manager_id;

#Right Join : Retrieve all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table, with NULL values in place where there is no match

# Ques : Display all managers and their associated department names, including managers without departments.
select mng.manager_name, dept.dept_name from department dept right join manager mng on dept.dept_id=mng.dept_id;

#Full Join : Retrieve all records from both tables, merging records where a match exists and including NULL values where there is no match.

# Ques :  Retrieve all employee and manager details, including those employees who are not managers and managers who do not have any employees reporting to them.
#Note : MySQL doesn't support the FULL JOIN syntax directly. Instead, you can simulate a FULL JOIN using a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, along with UNION to combine the results.
SELECT *
FROM employee emp
LEFT JOIN manager mng ON emp.manager_id = mng.manager_id
UNION
SELECT *
FROM employee emp
RIGHT JOIN manager mng ON emp.manager_id = mng.manager_id;


#Cross Join :Retrieve the Cartesian product of the two tables, resulting in a combination of all records from both tables.

# Ques:  Generate all possible combinations of employees and departments. 

select emp.*, dept.* from employee emp CROSS JOIN department dept;

#why Cross Join:
# Scenerio : Write a query to fetch the employee name and their corresponding department name, also make sure to display the company
# name and the comapny location corresponding to each employee

#Note : cross join doesn't need join condition

# Self join :  Join a table with itself, typically to compare rows within the same table.

# Natural Join : not same as inner join 

# Not recommended to use, Becuase SQL will decide on which column join should happen, so we don't need to use any join conidtions
