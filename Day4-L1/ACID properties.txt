What is ACID properties?

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are the four key characteristics that ensure 
the reliability and integrity of transactions in database management systems. 


Atomicity : A transaction is either executed entirely or not executed at all. ( No partial execution). Data remain automatic
---------

Consistency: Value should remain preserve always. the integrity of data should be maintained, which means any changes in database is made
-----------	     it should remain preserved.
			 
			 ----------					 |----------|
			 | 	A 	   |				 | A = 20   |
			 |---------|				/| C = 10   |
			 | T = 100 |               / | A = 30   | 
			 | D = 10  |---------------  |----------| 
			 | A = 90  |				\
			 | D = 20  |				 \|---------|
			 | A = 70  |				  |	A = 50  |
			 |---------|				  | C = 20  |
										  | A = 70  |
										  |---------|
										  
Isolation :  Multiple transactions occure independently without interference. Isolation means seperation, a property of database where no data should
-----------     effect other one and may occure concurrently.


Durability : the changes of a successful transaction occures even if the system failure occures. 
------------  Durability means data after the successful execution of the operation become parmanent in database
