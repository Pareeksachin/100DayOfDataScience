1.Mean: The average value of a dataset, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of 	values.

Example: Consider the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]. The mean is calculated as (10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30) / 5 = 20.

2.Median: The middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number 	of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Example: For the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30], the median is 20. If the dataset is [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35], the median is (20 + 25) / 2 = 22.5.

3.Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

Example: In the dataset [10, 15, 20, 20, 25, 30], the mode is 20 because it appears more frequently than other values.

4.Variance: A measure of the dispersion or spread of a dataset. It is calculated by averaging the squared 	differences between each value and the mean.

Example: Consider the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30] with a mean of 20. The squared differences are [(10-20)^2, (15-20)^2, (20-20)^2, (25-20)^2, (30-20)^2]. The variance is the average of these squared differences.

5.Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average deviation of each data 	point from the mean.

Example: If the variance of a dataset is 25, then the standard deviation is the square root of 25, which is 5.

6.Covariance: A measure of how two variables change together. Positive covariance indicates that when one variable 	increases, the other variable tends to increase as well, and vice versa for negative covariance.

Example: Consider two variables X and Y. If increases in X tend to coincide with increases in Y, they have positive covariance. If increases in X coincide with decreases in Y, they have negative covariance.

7.Correlation: A standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two 	variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a 	perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.

Example: A correlation coefficient of 0.8 between two variables X and Y indicates a strong positive linear 	relationship, while a correlation coefficient of -0.6 indicates a moderate negative linear relationship.



Covariance & Correlation:
-------------------------
Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

Correlation is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It measures both the strength and direction of the relationship.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

Consider two variables: X represents the number of hours studied for an exam, and Y represents the exam scores obtained.

If X and Y tend to increase or decrease together, they have a positive covariance. This indicates a positive relationship: as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. For instance, students who study more tend to score higher on exams.

If X increases while Y decreases, or vice versa, they have a negative covariance. This indicates a negative relationship: as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. For example, if students spend less time studying, their exam scores might decrease.

Covariance itself doesn't provide a clear measure of the strength of the relationship. That's where correlation comes in.

Correlation standardizes the measure, providing a value between -1 and 1.

A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship: as one variable increases, the other increases proportionally.
A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship: as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally.
A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables.
In summary, covariance measures the directional relationship between variables, while correlation additionally standardizes this measure to provide insights into the strength and direction of the relationship.
